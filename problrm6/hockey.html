        Hockey is a very fast and exciting sport. Hockey players skate at very
        high speeds, running into each other with great force, but skating and
        controlling the puck with great dexterity. The combination of skill,
        speed, toughness, and action has made hockey a popular sport to watch as
        well as play.
